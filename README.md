Some flashcard decks â†’ import into Anki

***ADVICE:***
- You may need change Display Order (New card gather order, New card sort order, New/Review order, Interday learning/review order, Review sort order) in Study Options/Deck Options to make sure cards show randomly.
- You may need change Daily Limits (New cards/day, Maximum reviews/day) in Study Options/Deck Options to select a study intensity that suits you and still leaves time for other activities.
